![sample.png](sample.png)

# Usage

## Run from Source

```bash
make run
```

## Build a Binary

```bash
make build
```

Executable will be created as verbose-twit-banner

## Ways of Operation

### Run in an Interval

Parameter `-interval=<string>` can be used
to make the program run in a loop.
The banner image will be updated
in the specified time interval (e.g. 5m).
Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"),
"ms", "s", "m", "h".

### Read-only mode

Parameter `-dry-run` can be used
to make the program output an image.

Could be useful if you want to see
what image it would output
without replacing your banner image

Another advantage of this method is that you don't need
Twitter Access Key & Secret
so you can run it on anyone's Twitter account.
